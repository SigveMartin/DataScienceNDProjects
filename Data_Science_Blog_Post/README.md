# Project 1: Writing a Data Science Blog Post

## Introduction
For this project, we will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio. 

The project outline was to; 

1) Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.
2) Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
3) Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
4) Evaluate your results.
5) Share your insights with stakeholders.

## Owerview and hand-ins 

This Github repository, with especially the [project notebook](/project_1_blogpost.ipynb), contains the code for this project. The project follows the CRISP-DM process outlined for questions through communication. 

In the project I chose to work on data of norwegian construction market, and look into how the construction industry could increase productivity and especially return on investments in heavy equipment. I found that a peer-to-peer rental platform for heavy machinery could account for as much as 11-20% of the current annual revenue. Hence, improving the ability to get return on invested capital and improve industry wide productivity.

## How to run the code

Clone the repository and create a conda environment using the provided ```environment.yml``` file included. Activate the environment and type ```jupyter notebook``` in your terminal while being in the cloned folder. Then you should be ablt to use the provided notebook.
