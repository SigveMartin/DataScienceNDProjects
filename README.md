# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program
Projects done as part of the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)


There will be added seperate folders per project done as part of the program. 

## Project 1: Writing a Data Science Blog Post

For this project, you will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of your own. You can gain some inspiration from Robert's posts here.

## Project 2: Disaster Response Pipeline

In this course, you've learned and built on your data engineering skills to expand your opportunities and potential as a data scientist. In this project, you'll apply these skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The project will include a webapp as illustrated below;
