# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program
Projects done as part of the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)


There will be added seperate folders per project done as part of the program.

## Project 1: Writing a Data Science Blog Post

For this project, we will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of your own. The blogpost is shown in the screenshot below. [Also found through this link](https://www.rebelsnarrative.com/machine-utilization).

## Project 2: Disaster Response Pipeline

In this course, you've learned and built on your data engineering skills to expand your opportunities and potential as a data scientist. In this project, you'll apply these skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The project will include a webapp as illustrated below;

## Project 3: Recommendations with IBM

In this project we will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles we think they will like. Below you can see an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Platform.
